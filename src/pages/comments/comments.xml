<p>One woman who was going hiking in Rome was given a watch that tracks distances and walking speed; a man traveling to Mexico to build houses for the homeless was given a care package of muscle ointment and adhesive bandages; an elderly woman traveling alone was upgraded to first class seating.</p>
<p>How did KLM know just which gifts to get each customer? The answer: social media.</p>
<h2>The experiment</h2>
<p>All this gift-giving was a part of <a href="http://www.klm.com/" target="_blank">KLM Surprise</a>, the company’s effort to not only connect with its customers on a personal level, but also an experiment in the power of social sharing.</p>
<p>Flight attendants browsed <a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://foursquare.com/" target="_blank">Foursquare</a>, looking for people who mentioned that they were taking a KLM flight. Then, using the information the customer provided about him or herself on social media platforms, the flight attendants purchased a suitable gift and presented it to the passenger upon his/her arrival at the airport.</p>
<p>According to the photos on the KLM Surprise website, at least 40 KLM customers were given gifts.</p>
<h2>The result: A social media storm</h2>
<p>40 isn’t a staggering number. But news of these surprises spread like wildfire through mentions, tweets, retweets, and word of mouth. In November, the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/KLMsurprise" target="_blank">KLM Twitter feed</a> was viewed more than <em>one million times</em>. Not bad for a company that wasn’t sure it could make social media work for them.</p>
<h2>What KLM did right</h2>
<h3>Being where their customers are</h3>
<p>KLM did their homework, and made it a priority to seek out their followers and create relationships with them. They created a website and Twitter feed dedicated to their campaign, joined Foursquare, and posted their video on their YouTube channel and the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/KLM" target="_blank">KLM Facebook Fan page</a>. They attempted to start and join conversations on those platforms, and get a feel for what their customers are like.</p>
<h3><strong>Knowing <i>who</i> their customers are</strong></h3>
<p>Then they took it one step forward and personalized their campaign. They could have saved time and presented those 40-some passengers with a generic gewgaw; instead, the employees took the time to learn more detail, and give their customers something that had real value to <em>them</em>.</p>
<h2>Where they missed an opportunity</h2>
<p>Although KLM did a great job of interacting with the 40 or so passengers to whom they presented gifts, their interaction with their wider customer base is lacking, and they have lost additional opportunities to develop their brand.</p>
<p>For example, of the 62 comments on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqHWAE8GDEk" target="_blank">KLM Surprise video on YouTube</a>, over ten of them are negative, several involving complaints about lost luggage and poor customer service. Perhaps these issues were solved through private messages or on other platforms; however, the lack of response from a KLM representative makes it appear that first, the company ignores their YouTube channel, and second, that they ignore their customers. These assumptions may be false — but first impressions are everything.</p>
<p>Secondly, despite researching I cannot find anything (published by KLM or a third-party group) that discusses the ROI of the experiment. Sure they got one million impressions on Twitter — but did they gain new customers? How many? Did flight bookings go up? What was the actual <em>goal</em> of the experiment?</p>
<p>I’d love to see a case study of KLM’s campaign. Was it worth the effort and time it took to research customers, the cost of the gifts, etc.? KLM has the potential to bring more legitimacy to the idea of using social media to boost business, and they’re letting it slip away.</p>
<h2>The takeway</h2>
<p>Although KLM certainly got a lot of social media attention by surprising their customers with gifts, I don’t think they capitalized on it as much as they could have. Now that the experiment is over, they don’t seem to be monitoring as closely the channels they were using to spread the word: their YouTube channel is ignored, and the KLM Suprise website is static.</p>
<p>The best thing about KLM’s experiment is that it has shown other businesses that social media can be a viable platform for connecting with customers and getting measurable results; the worst thing is that KLM had the opportunity to take it even a step further, and they fell short.</p>

<p>One woman who was going hiking in Rome was given a watch that tracks distances and walking speed; a man traveling to Mexico to build houses for the homeless was given a care package of muscle ointment and adhesive bandages; an elderly woman traveling alone was upgraded to first class seating.</p>
<p>How did KLM know just which gifts to get each customer? The answer: social media.</p>
<h2>The experiment</h2>
<p>All this gift-giving was a part of <a href="http://www.klm.com/" target="_blank">KLM Surprise</a>, the company’s effort to not only connect with its customers on a personal level, but also an experiment in the power of social sharing.</p>
<p>Flight attendants browsed <a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://foursquare.com/" target="_blank">Foursquare</a>, looking for people who mentioned that they were taking a KLM flight. Then, using the information the customer provided about him or herself on social media platforms, the flight attendants purchased a suitable gift and presented it to the passenger upon his/her arrival at the airport.</p>
<p>According to the photos on the KLM Surprise website, at least 40 KLM customers were given gifts.</p>
<h2>The result: A social media storm</h2>
<p>40 isn’t a staggering number. But news of these surprises spread like wildfire through mentions, tweets, retweets, and word of mouth. In November, the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/KLMsurprise" target="_blank">KLM Twitter feed</a> was viewed more than <em>one million times</em>. Not bad for a company that wasn’t sure it could make social media work for them.</p>
<h2>What KLM did right</h2>
<h3>Being where their customers are</h3>
<p>KLM did their homework, and made it a priority to seek out their followers and create relationships with them. They created a website and Twitter feed dedicated to their campaign, joined Foursquare, and posted their video on their YouTube channel and the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/KLM" target="_blank">KLM Facebook Fan page</a>. They attempted to start and join conversations on those platforms, and get a feel for what their customers are like.</p>
<h3><strong>Knowing <i>who</i> their customers are</strong></h3>
<p>Then they took it one step forward and personalized their campaign. They could have saved time and presented those 40-some passengers with a generic gewgaw; instead, the employees took the time to learn more detail, and give their customers something that had real value to <em>them</em>.</p>
<h2>Where they missed an opportunity</h2>
<p>Although KLM did a great job of interacting with the 40 or so passengers to whom they presented gifts, their interaction with their wider customer base is lacking, and they have lost additional opportunities to develop their brand.</p>
<p>For example, of the 62 comments on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqHWAE8GDEk" target="_blank">KLM Surprise video on YouTube</a>, over ten of them are negative, several involving complaints about lost luggage and poor customer service. Perhaps these issues were solved through private messages or on other platforms; however, the lack of response from a KLM representative makes it appear that first, the company ignores their YouTube channel, and second, that they ignore their customers. These assumptions may be false — but first impressions are everything.</p>
<p>Secondly, despite researching I cannot find anything (published by KLM or a third-party group) that discusses the ROI of the experiment. Sure they got one million impressions on Twitter — but did they gain new customers? How many? Did flight bookings go up? What was the actual <em>goal</em> of the experiment?</p>
<p>I’d love to see a case study of KLM’s campaign. Was it worth the effort and time it took to research customers, the cost of the gifts, etc.? KLM has the potential to bring more legitimacy to the idea of using social media to boost business, and they’re letting it slip away.</p>
<h2>The takeway</h2>
<p>Although KLM certainly got a lot of social media attention by surprising their customers with gifts, I don’t think they capitalized on it as much as they could have. Now that the experiment is over, they don’t seem to be monitoring as closely the channels they were using to spread the word: their YouTube channel is ignored, and the KLM Suprise website is static.</p>
<p>The best thing about KLM’s experiment is that it has shown other businesses that social media can be a viable platform for connecting with customers and getting measurable results; the worst thing is that KLM had the opportunity to take it even a step further, and they fell short.</p>

The goal is to maximize your return on investment (ROI) by using keywords which are most relevant to your business, and are more likely to result in traffic, conversions, and sales.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the best ROI for your business, it is critical to avoid mistakes which result in an inefficient use of budget and poorly performing PPC campaigns. Here are 10 common mistakes and how to avoid them.</p>
<p><strong>1. Setting a daily budget </strong></p>
<p>Google AdWords allows you to set a daily budget for each campaign in an account. Once a budget is set, AdWords does its best to not accrue more clicks per day than the budget allows. For many who are new to PPC this is a tempting feature, because it gives total control over the budget; unfortunately it gives that control to the program, rather than to you.</p>
<p>When your daily budget is close to being expended, AdWords starts to throttle the number of times your ads show. This slows the budget spend, but your business comes up fewer times in search results. This means fewer chances for a user to see your ad, visit your site, and convert.</p>
<p>We’ve found that by not setting a daily budget--or by setting an extremely high one--we can be sure that AdWords is showing our clients’ ads as often as the keywords are being searched on. The trade-off is that we have to keep a closer eye on our campaigns to make sure that we are not exceeding the budget.</p>
<p><strong>2. Using only one ad group </strong></p>
<p>In any AdWords account there can be up to 25 campaigns, and within each campaign there can be 2,000 ad groups. Although most accounts are run optimally with far fewer campaigns and ad groups, the ability to be as granular as possible should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>AdWords attempts to target keywords within an ad group to the ads you create -- if a keyword does not match up well with any of the ads, it will not be used. A bookstore owner who dumps all his keywords into a single ad group will have difficulty targeting those keywords to specific ads within that group. Keyword <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=49174" target="_blank">Quality Scores</a> will suffer, which leads to having to bid more to have ads shown.</p>
<p>Instead of lumping everything together, the bookstore owner might begin by separating all his keywords and ads related to children’s books into one ad group, and then create another ad group which would contain keywords and ads related to biographies, another to journals, and so forth.</p>
<p>By placing targeted related keywords into a common AdWords ad group, and creating ads which correspond to those keywords, you will maintain tighter control over the group’s performance. All of your ads will be relevant to all of your keywords, increasing the campaign’s effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>3. Poorly researched keywords </strong></p>
<p>PPC campaigns begin with keywords, and keyword should always start with research. What keywords or phrases are important to your business? Are people searching for those phrases? Use the same keywords your customers do; if you sell a line of energy bars, don’t spend time trying to rank well for the keyword energy bars if your customers call them meal replacement bars.</p>
<p>Shorter, more generic keywords require higher bids, and visitors who search with them are often in the research and browsing phase of the buying cycle. Getting people to your site is important -- but it’s also important that those visitors be qualified leads who are interested in converting. Around here we’re big fans of <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/whiteboard-friday-ignore-the-tail-at-your-peril" target="_blank">long tail keywords</a>: they cost less than bidding on more popular, less specific keywords, and they ensure that our campaigns weed out the tire-kickers.</p>
<p>I use free programs like <a href="https://adwords.google.com/o/Targeting/Explorer?__u=1000000000&amp;__c=1000000000&amp;ideaRequestType=KEYWORD_IDEAS#search.none" target="_blank">Google Keyword Tool</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#" target="_blank">Google Insights for Search</a> to see what keywords are most popular in my area and around the globe; for a closer look at the keywords visitors to our sites are using, I create a keyword report in my analytics program.</p>
<p><strong>4. Too many keywords </strong></p>
<p>As I’ve discovered, it is possible for keyword research to go <em>too</em> far. My research may have yielded a list of hundreds or thousands of keywords, but it’s important for me to remember that I will have to manage all of them. It is easier to optimize a list of 20 - 30 keywords than it is to optimize a list of hundreds.</p>
<p>If your current campaigns have lots of extraneous words, getting rid of them will clear space and time for you to optimize the keywords which are performing well. I recently did a “keyword dump” in an account, and now feel as if I have a better handle on managing it.</p>
<p><strong>5. Ignoring negative keywords </strong></p>
<p>When it comes to optimizing a PPC campaign, you need to avoid clicks which result in bounces. One quick, easy way to lessen these fruitless clicks without having to spend hours with your keywords lists is to add <em>negative keywords</em> to your campaigns. Negative keywords are words or phrases for which you tell AdWords <em>not</em> to trigger your ads.</p>
<p>A large company which specializes in home building and selling will want to rank well for keywords like <em>home builder</em> and <em>new homes</em>. However, because they do not rent homes or build apartments or condominiums, their negative keywords may be phrases such as <em>apartments</em>, <em>new condominiums</em>, and <em>homes for rent</em>.</p>
<p>By adding these as negative keywords, the home builder will minimize clicks from people who are searching for services the company doesn’t provide. This means a lower bounce rate, more profitable visits, and a more optimized PPC campaign.</p>
<p><strong>6. Not scoping out the competition</strong></p>
<p>Very few businesses have zero competition. Take some time to see what your top two or three competitors are doing with PPC. See what keywords are triggering their ads, what position those ads are in search results, and what the ads themselves say. Avoid the mistakes they’re making and improve on what they’re doing right.</p>
<p><strong>7. Not including keywords in ad text </strong></p>
<p>When the keyword or phrase a user searches with triggers an ad that contains that exact phrase, the phrase will be in bold in the search results. Google wants users to find what they’re looking for and knows when an ad is relevant -- bold text attracts the eye, making it more likely for the ad to be noticed and clicked on.</p>
<p>While many ad writers place keywords in ads’ titles, they often forget to include in the ads’ text. An ad in which a given phrase is included two times will have more relevance according to Google, and will have twice the amount of bold text, making it more prominent.</p>
<p><strong>8. Sending visitors to your homepage </strong></p>
<p>After I’ve spent time doing keyword research and creating multiple specific ad groups, I don’t undo all my work by making a website’s homepage the destination URL for all of my new ads.</p>
<p>It’s my goal to make it as easy and quick as possible for a website’s visitors to find what they want. In the same way that I spend time correlating ads to keywords, I also make sure that the ads I’m creating take visitors to a relevant page: an ad for a 50% off sale should take the visitor to a landing page which talks about that sale, or the products which are eligible for it.</p>
<p>Keyword Quality Scores are based on the relevancy of the content to which ads are directed; sending an ad to an irrelevant page will result in lower scores, and you will have to bid more on your keywords to retain your ads’ placement in search results.</p>
<p>If you do not have a relevant page to which to direct a user, consider whether or not the ad is relevant to your campaigns. If it is, create a separate landing page with relevant content and direct the ad there.</p>
<p><strong>9. Not tracking conversions</strong></p>
<p>Much of your effort is wasted if you’re not tracking your campaign’s effectiveness: the only way to determine the success of your PPC campaigns is by tracking the actions you want your customers to take on your website (filling out a contact form, downloading a white paper, making a purchase, etc.).</p>
<p><a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=86275" target="_blank">Setting up conversion tracking</a> in AdWords is easy, and once it’s enabled you will be able to see which campaigns, ads, and keywords are bringing you the best ROI.</p>
<p><strong>10. Not testing</strong></p>
<p>Testing is something you should be doing, even if you have a satisfactory conversion rate.</p>
<p>Test everything. Periodically research new keywords; weed out keywords with few impressions and no clicks; set your <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=112876" target="_blank">ad rotation</a> to “Optimize” and AdWords will show ads with higher click-through rates more often, ensuring better positions in search engine results.</p>
<p>Conduct <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=71976" target="_blank">A/B testing</a> on your website’s landing pages, and see which version leads to more conversions. Don’t be afraid to go over budget if it means an improved ROI.</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The mistakes described here are common, and need only time and diligence to correct. Taking time to research, set up tracking, and test your PPC campaigns is half the battle of SEO -- by avoiding these mistakes you will improve your campaigns, increase conversions, make your spending more effective, and improve your return on investment.</p>

<p>By adding these as negative keywords, the home builder will minimize clicks from people who are searching for services the company doesn’t provide. This means a lower bounce rate, more profitable visits, and a more optimized PPC campaign.</p>
<p><strong>6. Not scoping out the competition</strong></p>
<p>Very few businesses have zero competition. Take some time to see what your top two or three competitors are doing with PPC. See what keywords are triggering their ads, what position those ads are in search results, and what the ads themselves say. Avoid the mistakes they’re making and improve on what they’re doing right.</p>
<p><strong>7. Not including keywords in ad text </strong></p>
<p>When the keyword or phrase a user searches with triggers an ad that contains that exact phrase, the phrase will be in bold in the search results. Google wants users to find what they’re looking for and knows when an ad is relevant -- bold text attracts the eye, making it more likely for the ad to be noticed and clicked on.</p>
<p>While many ad writers place keywords in ads’ titles, they often forget to include in the ads’ text. An ad in which a given phrase is included two times will have more relevance according to Google, and will have twice the amount of bold text, making it more prominent.</p>
<p><strong>8. Sending visitors to your homepage </strong></p>
<p>After I’ve spent time doing keyword research and creating multiple specific ad groups, I don’t undo all my work by making a website’s homepage the destination URL for all of my new ads.</p>
<p>It’s my goal to make it as easy and quick as possible for a website’s visitors to find what they want. In the same way that I spend time correlating ads to keywords, I also make sure that the ads I’m creating take visitors to a relevant page: an ad for a 50% off sale should take the visitor to a landing page which talks about that sale, or the products which are eligible for it.</p>
<p>Keyword Quality Scores are based on the relevancy of the content to which ads are directed; sending an ad to an irrelevant page will result in lower scores, and you will have to bid more on your keywords to retain your ads’ placement in search results.</p>
<p>If you do not have a relevant page to which to direct a user, consider whether or not the ad is relevant to your campaigns. If it is, create a separate landing page with relevant content and direct the ad there.</p>
<p><strong>9. Not tracking conversions</strong></p>
<p>Much of your effort is wasted if you’re not tracking your campaign’s effectiveness: the only way to determine the success of your PPC campaigns is by tracking the actions you want your customers to take on your website (filling out a contact form, downloading a white paper, making a purchase, etc.).</p>
<p><a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=86275" target="_blank">Setting up conversion tracking</a> in AdWords is easy, and once it’s enabled you will be able to see which campaigns, ads, and keywords are bringing you the best ROI.</p>
<p><strong>10. Not testing</strong></p>
<p>Testing is something you should be doing, even if you have a satisfactory conversion rate.</p>
<p>Test everything. Periodically research new keywords; weed out keywords with few impressions and no clicks; set your <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=112876" target="_blank">ad rotation</a> to “Optimize” and AdWords will show ads with higher click-through rates more often, ensuring better positions in search engine results.</p>
<p>Conduct <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=71976" target="_blank">A/B testing</a> on your website’s landing pages, and see which version leads to more conversions. Don’t be afraid to go over budget if it means an improved ROI.</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The mistakes described here are common, and need only time and diligence to correct. Taking time to research, set up tracking, and test your PPC campaigns is half the battle of SEO -- by avoiding these mistakes you will improve your campaigns, increase conversions, make your spending more effective, and improve your return on investment.</p>

<p>The two things you mention, budget and value, really depend on the customer for whom you're setting up AdWords. </p>
<p>Different industries have different levels of competition, so some businesses have to utilize higher budgets in order to have their ads rank high.</p>
<p>Value per lead is also set by the customer. How much money do they make when a person buys a product or service, compared to how much it costs to get them to buy (from search to clink to conversion)?</p>
<p>These are both subjective categories, and change from business to business.</p>

The goal is to maximize your return on investment (ROI) by using keywords which are most relevant to your business, and are more likely to result in traffic, conversions, and sales.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the best ROI for your business, it is critical to avoid mistakes which result in an inefficient use of budget and poorly performing PPC campaigns. Here are 10 common mistakes and how to avoid them.</p>
<p><strong>1. Setting a daily budget </strong></p>
<p>Google AdWords allows you to set a daily budget for each campaign in an account. Once a budget is set, AdWords does its best to not accrue more clicks per day than the budget allows. For many who are new to PPC this is a tempting feature, because it gives total control over the budget; unfortunately it gives that control to the program, rather than to you.</p>
<p>When your daily budget is close to being expended, AdWords starts to throttle the number of times your ads show. This slows the budget spend, but your business comes up fewer times in search results. This means fewer chances for a user to see your ad, visit your site, and convert.</p>
<p>We’ve found that by not setting a daily budget--or by setting an extremely high one--we can be sure that AdWords is showing our clients’ ads as often as the keywords are being searched on. The trade-off is that we have to keep a closer eye on our campaigns to make sure that we are not exceeding the budget.</p>
<p><strong>2. Using only one ad group </strong></p>
<p>In any AdWords account there can be up to 25 campaigns, and within each campaign there can be 2,000 ad groups. Although most accounts are run optimally with far fewer campaigns and ad groups, the ability to be as granular as possible should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>AdWords attempts to target keywords within an ad group to the ads you create -- if a keyword does not match up well with any of the ads, it will not be used. A bookstore owner who dumps all his keywords into a single ad group will have difficulty targeting those keywords to specific ads within that group. Keyword <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=49174" target="_blank">Quality Scores</a> will suffer, which leads to having to bid more to have ads shown.</p>
<p>Instead of lumping everything together, the bookstore owner might begin by separating all his keywords and ads related to children’s books into one ad group, and then create another ad group which would contain keywords and ads related to biographies, another to journals, and so forth.</p>
<p>By placing targeted related keywords into a common AdWords ad group, and creating ads which correspond to those keywords, you will maintain tighter control over the group’s performance. All of your ads will be relevant to all of your keywords, increasing the campaign’s effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>3. Poorly researched keywords </strong></p>
<p>PPC campaigns begin with keywords, and keyword should always start with research. What keywords or phrases are important to your business? Are people searching for those phrases? Use the same keywords your customers do; if you sell a line of energy bars, don’t spend time trying to rank well for the keyword energy bars if your customers call them meal replacement bars.</p>
<p>Shorter, more generic keywords require higher bids, and visitors who search with them are often in the research and browsing phase of the buying cycle. Getting people to your site is important -- but it’s also important that those visitors be qualified leads who are interested in converting. Around here we’re big fans of <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/whiteboard-friday-ignore-the-tail-at-your-peril" target="_blank">long tail keywords</a>: they cost less than bidding on more popular, less specific keywords, and they ensure that our campaigns weed out the tire-kickers.</p>
<p>I use free programs like <a href="https://adwords.google.com/o/Targeting/Explorer?__u=1000000000&amp;__c=1000000000&amp;ideaRequestType=KEYWORD_IDEAS#search.none" target="_blank">Google Keyword Tool</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#" target="_blank">Google Insights for Search</a> to see what keywords are most popular in my area and around the globe; for a closer look at the keywords visitors to our sites are using, I create a keyword report in my analytics program.</p>
<p><strong>4. Too many keywords </strong></p>
<p>As I’ve discovered, it is possible for keyword research to go <em>too</em> far. My research may have yielded a list of hundreds or thousands of keywords, but it’s important for me to remember that I will have to manage all of them. It is easier to optimize a list of 20 - 30 keywords than it is to optimize a list of hundreds.</p>
<p>If your current campaigns have lots of extraneous words, getting rid of them will clear space and time for you to optimize the keywords which are performing well. I recently did a “keyword dump” in an account, and now feel as if I have a better handle on managing it.</p>
<p><strong>5. Ignoring negative keywords </strong></p>
<p>When it comes to optimizing a PPC campaign, you need to avoid clicks which result in bounces. One quick, easy way to lessen these fruitless clicks without having to spend hours with your keywords lists is to add <em>negative keywords</em> to your campaigns. Negative keywords are words or phrases for which you tell AdWords <em>not</em> to trigger your ads.</p>
<p>A large company which specializes in home building and selling will want to rank well for keywords like <em>home builder</em> and <em>new homes</em>. However, because they do not rent homes or build apartments or condominiums, their negative keywords may be phrases such as <em>apartments</em>, <em>new condominiums</em>, and <em>homes for rent</em>.</p>
<p>By adding these as negative keywords, the home builder will minimize clicks from people who are searching for services the company doesn’t provide. This means a lower bounce rate, more profitable visits, and a more optimized PPC campaign.</p>

<p>I use free programs like <a href="https://adwords.google.com/o/Targeting/Explorer?__u=1000000000&amp;__c=1000000000&amp;ideaRequestType=KEYWORD_IDEAS#search.none" target="_blank">Google Keyword Tool</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#" target="_blank">Google Insights for Search</a> to see what keywords are most popular in my area and around the globe; for a closer look at the keywords visitors to our sites are using, I create a keyword report in my analytics program.</p>
<p><strong>4. Too many keywords </strong></p>
<p>As I’ve discovered, it is possible for keyword research to go <em>too</em> far. My research may have yielded a list of hundreds or thousands of keywords, but it’s important for me to remember that I will have to manage all of them. It is easier to optimize a list of 20 - 30 keywords than it is to optimize a list of hundreds.</p>
<p>If your current campaigns have lots of extraneous words, getting rid of them will clear space and time for you to optimize the keywords which are performing well. I recently did a “keyword dump” in an account, and now feel as if I have a better handle on managing it.</p>
<p><strong>5. Ignoring negative keywords </strong></p>
<p>When it comes to optimizing a PPC campaign, you need to avoid clicks which result in bounces. One quick, easy way to lessen these fruitless clicks without having to spend hours with your keywords lists is to add <em>negative keywords</em> to your campaigns. Negative keywords are words or phrases for which you tell AdWords <em>not</em> to trigger your ads.</p>
<p>A large company which specializes in home building and selling will want to rank well for keywords like <em>home builder</em> and <em>new homes</em>. However, because they do not rent homes or build apartments or condominiums, their negative keywords may be phrases such as <em>apartments</em>, <em>new condominiums</em>, and <em>homes for rent</em>.</p>
<p>By adding these as negative keywords, the home builder will minimize clicks from people who are searching for services the company doesn’t provide. This means a lower bounce rate, more profitable visits, and a more optimized PPC campaign.</p>
<p><strong>6. Not scoping out the competition</strong></p>
<p>Very few businesses have zero competition. Take some time to see what your top two or three competitors are doing with PPC. See what keywords are triggering their ads, what position those ads are in search results, and what the ads themselves say. Avoid the mistakes they’re making and improve on what they’re doing right.</p>
<p><strong>7. Not including keywords in ad text </strong></p>
<p>When the keyword or phrase a user searches with triggers an ad that contains that exact phrase, the phrase will be in bold in the search results. Google wants users to find what they’re looking for and knows when an ad is relevant -- bold text attracts the eye, making it more likely for the ad to be noticed and clicked on.</p>
<p>While many ad writers place keywords in ads’ titles, they often forget to include in the ads’ text. An ad in which a given phrase is included two times will have more relevance according to Google, and will have twice the amount of bold text, making it more prominent.</p>
<p><strong>8. Sending visitors to your homepage </strong></p>
<p>After I’ve spent time doing keyword research and creating multiple specific ad groups, I don’t undo all my work by making a website’s homepage the destination URL for all of my new ads.</p>
<p>It’s my goal to make it as easy and quick as possible for a website’s visitors to find what they want. In the same way that I spend time correlating ads to keywords, I also make sure that the ads I’m creating take visitors to a relevant page: an ad for a 50% off sale should take the visitor to a landing page which talks about that sale, or the products which are eligible for it.</p>
<p>Keyword Quality Scores are based on the relevancy of the content to which ads are directed; sending an ad to an irrelevant page will result in lower scores, and you will have to bid more on your keywords to retain your ads’ placement in search results.</p>
<p>If you do not have a relevant page to which to direct a user, consider whether or not the ad is relevant to your campaigns. If it is, create a separate landing page with relevant content and direct the ad there.</p>
<p><strong>9. Not tracking conversions</strong></p>
<p>Much of your effort is wasted if you’re not tracking your campaign’s effectiveness: the only way to determine the success of your PPC campaigns is by tracking the actions you want your customers to take on your website (filling out a contact form, downloading a white paper, making a purchase, etc.).</p>
<p><a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=86275" target="_blank">Setting up conversion tracking</a> in AdWords is easy, and once it’s enabled you will be able to see which campaigns, ads, and keywords are bringing you the best ROI.</p>
<p><strong>10. Not testing</strong></p>
<p>Testing is something you should be doing, even if you have a satisfactory conversion rate.</p>
<p>Test everything. Periodically research new keywords; weed out keywords with few impressions and no clicks; set your <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=112876" target="_blank">ad rotation</a> to “Optimize” and AdWords will show ads with higher click-through rates more often, ensuring better positions in search engine results.</p>
<p>Conduct <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=71976" target="_blank">A/B testing</a> on your website’s landing pages, and see which version leads to more conversions. Don’t be afraid to go over budget if it means an improved ROI.</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The mistakes described here are common, and need only time and diligence to correct. Taking time to research, set up tracking, and test your PPC campaigns is half the battle of SEO -- by avoiding these mistakes you will improve your campaigns, increase conversions, make your spending more effective, and improve your return on investment.</p>

My logic is - Id rather go a day without a click but when i get that click and someone calls me or emails me and that reverts to a sale it was worth it. Versus having to pay for clicks from Texas when they could never covert to a sale because its out of my service area which is California. I think a lot of adwords users fail to geo target and this results in unwanted clicks and quick wasting away of there budget. Also by geotargeting I can have a small budget say 100 a month that suits me perfectly. With my campaigns im pretty much guaranteed to be in the top position in adwords for the specific keywords ive chosen and I also studied my competition so i know pretty much what keywords they use and I now use them as well.

The goal is to maximize your return on investment (ROI) by using keywords which are most relevant to your business, and are more likely to result in traffic, conversions, and sales.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the best ROI for your business, it is critical to avoid mistakes which result in an inefficient use of budget and poorly performing PPC campaigns. Here are 10 common mistakes and how to avoid them.</p>
<p><strong>1. Setting a daily budget </strong></p>
<p>Google AdWords allows you to set a daily budget for each campaign in an account. Once a budget is set, AdWords does its best to not accrue more clicks per day than the budget allows. For many who are new to PPC this is a tempting feature, because it gives total control over the budget; unfortunately it gives that control to the program, rather than to you.</p>
<p>When your daily budget is close to being expended, AdWords starts to throttle the number of times your ads show. This slows the budget spend, but your business comes up fewer times in search results. This means fewer chances for a user to see your ad, visit your site, and convert.</p>
<p>We’ve found that by not setting a daily budget--or by setting an extremely high one--we can be sure that AdWords is showing our clients’ ads as often as the keywords are being searched on. The trade-off is that we have to keep a closer eye on our campaigns to make sure that we are not exceeding the budget.</p>
<p><strong>2. Using only one ad group </strong></p>
<p>In any AdWords account there can be up to 25 campaigns, and within each campaign there can be 2,000 ad groups. Although most accounts are run optimally with far fewer campaigns and ad groups, the ability to be as granular as possible should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>AdWords attempts to target keywords within an ad group to the ads you create -- if a keyword does not match up well with any of the ads, it will not be used. A bookstore owner who dumps all his keywords into a single ad group will have difficulty targeting those keywords to specific ads within that group. Keyword <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=49174" target="_blank">Quality Scores</a> will suffer, which leads to having to bid more to have ads shown.</p>
<p>Instead of lumping everything together, the bookstore owner might begin by separating all his keywords and ads related to children’s books into one ad group, and then create another ad group which would contain keywords and ads related to biographies, another to journals, and so forth.</p>
<p>By placing targeted related keywords into a common AdWords ad group, and creating ads which correspond to those keywords, you will maintain tighter control over the group’s performance. All of your ads will be relevant to all of your keywords, increasing the campaign’s effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>3. Poorly researched keywords </strong></p>
<p>PPC campaigns begin with keywords, and keyword should always start with research. What keywords or phrases are important to your business? Are people searching for those phrases? Use the same keywords your customers do; if you sell a line of energy bars, don’t spend time trying to rank well for the keyword energy bars if your customers call them meal replacement bars.</p>
<p>Shorter, more generic keywords require higher bids, and visitors who search with them are often in the research and browsing phase of the buying cycle. Getting people to your site is important -- but it’s also important that those visitors be qualified leads who are interested in converting. Around here we’re big fans of <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/whiteboard-friday-ignore-the-tail-at-your-peril" target="_blank">long tail keywords</a>: they cost less than bidding on more popular, less specific keywords, and they ensure that our campaigns weed out the tire-kickers.</p>
<p>I use free programs like <a href="https://adwords.google.com/o/Targeting/Explorer?__u=1000000000&amp;__c=1000000000&amp;ideaRequestType=KEYWORD_IDEAS#search.none" target="_blank">Google Keyword Tool</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#" target="_blank">Google Insights for Search</a> to see what keywords are most popular in my area and around the globe; for a closer look at the keywords visitors to our sites are using, I create a keyword report in my analytics program.</p>

Geo-targeting is under-utilized, but can be a great way to narrow down your audience and keep CPCs affordable.</p>
]]></wp:comment_content><wp:comment_approved>1</wp:comment_approved><wp:comment_parent>1649</wp:comment_parent></wp:comment></item><item><title>Welcome LiquidFrameworks.com</title><link>http://digett.netlify.com/insights/welcome-liquidframeworkscom</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Liquid Frameworks, of the newly Digett-created <a target="_blank" href="http://liquidframeworks.com">liquidframeworks.com</a>, came  to Digett to redesign their former website with two main goals in mind: </p>
<ol><li>They wanted their new site to be as impressive visually as their work is technically. </li>
<li>Their new site also needed to provide prospective clients a more complete picture of all their products, approaches, and services to present Liquid Frameworks as a professional, highly evolved, multi-faceted solutions provider for businesses.</li>
</ol><!--break--><h2>Modern, eye-catching design </h2>
<p>We're  not embarrassed to admit that our first design concept for the home page fell flat. It was crisp and clean, sure, but it wasn't exactly what  Liquid Frameworks was looking for. During their initial feedback session, they told us something we love to hear: they wanted something bolder. </p>
<p>Since reworking design and incorporating client requests  is part of any <a target="_blank" href="/2010/02/01/digett-delivery-process" title="iterative process">iterative design process</a>, and because we had, admittedly, skewed a little conservatively with the first design, we were excited for an opportunity to do something a little less traditional in our second round of mock-ups.</p>
<p><img class="right filter-image-invalid" src="/core/misc/icons/e32700/error.svg" width="16" height="16" alt="Image removed." title="This image has been removed. For security reasons, only images from the local domain are allowed." />Spurred on by eloquent feedback from the Liquid Frameworks team after every design update, we were able to deliver a design that lends itself better to the personality of Liquid Frameworks and which will help them stand out from their competitors.</p>
<h2>Reflection of range of expertise</h2>
<p>We used the home page to better represent Liquid Frameworks' breadth of work. Their previous website primarily highlighted their FieldPro product offering, which, unfortunately, meant that all their other offerings were underrepresented. Today, their home page more fairly showcases their true range of expertise in SharePoint and .Net development, as well as other corporate development systems. </p>
<p>By showing their three main expertise categories in sliding javascript elements, we also were able to maximize use of page real estate as well as give the page some subtle movement and encourage user engagement. </p>
<h2>Highlight thought leadership</h2>
<p>When Liquid Frameworks moved away from the singular focus on FieldPro on their website, it gave them the opportunity to showcase their thought leadership across expertise and industry.</p>
<p>On the home page and on selected sidebars throughout the site, users can view and download whitepapers relevant to designated solutions and services as assigned by Liquid Frameworks through Drupal. Whitepapers give concrete examples of how Liquid Frameworks is solving problems for businesses with their software development and products. They also serve as a lead generation tool, as users must provide a name and email address before they have download access. </p>
<p>Whitepapers have a sense of formality to them, though, that isn't always the appropriate outlet for all thought leadership. For discussions about tackling typical business problems and Liquid Frameworks' technologies, methodologies, and approaches, they take to their blog. Eventually, Liquid Frameworks hopes to have each of their developers contributing about their everyday work challenges and solutions. </p>
<h2>It all comes together</h2>
<p>By detailing the kinds of business problems they are able to solve and presenting an equal emphasis on their solutions, services, and their approaches to them, Liquid Frameworks new website will automatically set them apart as a business solutions leader.</p>

Your Email List With Flowtown</title><link>http://localhost:8000/insights/leverage-or-exploit-your-email-list-flowtown</link><content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today I imported a small sample of one of Digett’s subscriber lists housed at CampaignMonitor into <a target="_blank" title="Flowtown" href="http://www.flowtown.com">Flowtown</a> for the first time. Flowtown is a brand-spanking-new social media mining tool that takes my company’s email subscriber lists and tells me way more than I thought possible about my subscribers. The results are pretty stunning—almost scary, really.</p>
<!--break--><p> What once was a very generic list of generally faceless and unknown newsletter subscribers suddenly talkes on a multi-dimensional and “living” character, as Flowtown matches a significant percentage of imported email addresses with one or more of their owners’ social media profiles.</p>
<h2>A Whole New World</h2>
<p>Anecdotally put, in the time it took to enjoy a single sip of coffee, “john@johndoe.com” became Jonathon Douglas Doe, Jr., and Flowtown gave me links to John’s Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, and LinkedIn profiles, as well as his photostream on Flickr, his music list on Pandora, and his wishlist on Amazon. I went from knowing John’s email address to knowing what he had for breakfast (from his last tweet), who he hangs out with (from his Facebook profile), where he works, and what he does for a living (from his LinkedIn profile). I also happen to know now that John likes fishing and running. Whoa.</p>
<p>Because I imported my list into Flowtown directly from <a title="CampaignMonitor" target="_blank" href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com">CampaignMonitor</a>, Flowtown inserted custom fields into my CampaignMonitor subscriber list and injected values for fields it labeled networks (the social networks the subscriber is associated with), city, state, country, gender, and age group. Suddenly, the gross inattention I’ve shown toward segmenting our own house list seems slightly less consequential, as I now have a remarkable amount of data associated with my subscribers, all at minimal cost in time, effort, and dollars.</p>
<h2>Klout Integration</h2>
<p>One other piece worth mentioning is Flowtown’s integration with <a target="_blank" title="Klout" href="http://www.klout.com">Klout</a>, which allows Flowtown to display an “influence rating” for each of your subscribers—or at least those for whom Flowtown finds an associated Twitter profile. I’ve not used Klout before, so I had to experiment with it a little for myself. Klout “scores” a person’s influence on Twitter as determined through consideration of five criteria:</p>
<ul><li>    Reach—person is gaining a strong following and message is being heard</li>
<li>Demand—person is sure to engage with others and not just follow to be followed</li>
<li>Engagement—person works on building relationships through conversation</li>
<li>Velocity—content has been interesting enough for others to spread</li>
<li>Activity—person is able to generate conversations with very influential people</li>
</ul><p>By knowing the Klout score of your subscribers, you theoretically have a prioritized list of people that you may want to engage with more often if you want your own messages to be spread.</p>
<h2>Email Campaign Generation</h2>
<p>Turns out that Flowtown has a rudimentary email campaign capability built right in. So if you’re not using CampaignMonitor, MailChimp, or one of the many other platforms, you could conceivably use Flowtown’s built-in email platform. However, my own inspection of this facility—admittedly a bit hurried—revealed an interface too simplistic to indicate a well-developed tool. I did notice, however, an auto-responder capability, something that’s been missing from CampaignMonitor for way too long, in my opinion.</p>
<p>Since the campaign tool is probably not extremely useful, then Flowtown’s ability to provide code allowing one to embed a subscription signup form on one’s website may not be practical, either. But keep in mind, Flowtown is brand new, and my guess is that many of the seemingly immature features will continue to develop over time. Given, however, their choice to integrate with popular and rock-solid email services like CampaignMonitor and MailChimp, I’m thinking that developing another alternative to existing email platforms may be more of a distraction for Flowtown right now than its value would warrant.</p>
<h2>Is it Useful?</h2>
<p>So we have this frightening amount of information about our subscribers at our fingertips. Now what do we do with it? Simply knowing something about a subscriber does not necessarily improve my marketing tactics if I fail to make use of it. And just because I suddenly know where to find you on four or five separate social networks doesn’t make me your online friend. I'm wondering whether I wouldn’t personally be creeped out a little if someone approached me through Facebook, for example, and said “Hey, I see you subscribed to my company’s email newsletter! Can we be friends?” Uh, that would be a “no.”</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. While I might struggle to envision a practical scenario for leveraging this information in a meaningful way, I can’t help but think someone, somewhere will find great value in it. Truth be told, after exploring the social media profiles of only a few subscribers on my newly augmented subscriber list for just a few minutes, I reached out to one of them on <a target="_blank" title="LinkedIn" href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn</a>, gaining a new connection in the process.</p>
<p>I used a pickup line similar to the one above, mentioning that I noticed they subscribed to our newsletter. I wanted to see the reaction I would get and figured LinkedIn users might be less annoyed with this type of approach than would users of a more intimate and personal network. For what it’s worth, my new connection seemed totally unaffected by my mining of his information, whether out of ignorance or indifference. Maybe I’ll recognize more opportunities to leverage Flowtown now that I’m aware of this amazing capability.</p>
<p>I’ll end on a cautionary note. This post might serve as a wake-up call for those of you who were not aware that by just providing an email address you potentially open up details of your life to be seen by people whom you may not have known existed. It’s fine if you’re okay with that. But if not, you might want to point your browser to Flowtown for yourself. Try it out for free to see what they might be revealing about you.</p>

It is scary - glad I have three email addresses: One for Junk, One for Work and one for Personal.
