<p>One woman who was going hiking in Rome was given a watch that tracks distances and walking speed; a man traveling to Mexico to build houses for the homeless was given a care package of muscle ointment and adhesive bandages; an elderly woman traveling alone was upgraded to first class seating.</p>
<p>How did KLM know just which gifts to get each customer? The answer: social media.</p>
<h2>The experiment</h2>
<p>All this gift-giving was a part of <a href="http://www.klm.com/" target="_blank">KLM Surprise</a>, the company’s effort to not only connect with its customers on a personal level, but also an experiment in the power of social sharing.</p>
<p>Flight attendants browsed <a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://foursquare.com/" target="_blank">Foursquare</a>, looking for people who mentioned that they were taking a KLM flight. Then, using the information the customer provided about him or herself on social media platforms, the flight attendants purchased a suitable gift and presented it to the passenger upon his/her arrival at the airport.</p>
<p>According to the photos on the KLM Surprise website, at least 40 KLM customers were given gifts.</p>
<h2>The result: A social media storm</h2>
<p>40 isn’t a staggering number. But news of these surprises spread like wildfire through mentions, tweets, retweets, and word of mouth. In November, the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/KLMsurprise" target="_blank">KLM Twitter feed</a> was viewed more than <em>one million times</em>. Not bad for a company that wasn’t sure it could make social media work for them.</p>
<h2>What KLM did right</h2>
<h3>Being where their customers are</h3>
<p>KLM did their homework, and made it a priority to seek out their followers and create relationships with them. They created a website and Twitter feed dedicated to their campaign, joined Foursquare, and posted their video on their YouTube channel and the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/KLM" target="_blank">KLM Facebook Fan page</a>. They attempted to start and join conversations on those platforms, and get a feel for what their customers are like.</p>
<h3><strong>Knowing <i>who</i> their customers are</strong></h3>
<p>Then they took it one step forward and personalized their campaign. They could have saved time and presented those 40-some passengers with a generic gewgaw; instead, the employees took the time to learn more detail, and give their customers something that had real value to <em>them</em>.</p>
<h2>Where they missed an opportunity</h2>
<p>Although KLM did a great job of interacting with the 40 or so passengers to whom they presented gifts, their interaction with their wider customer base is lacking, and they have lost additional opportunities to develop their brand.</p>
<p>For example, of the 62 comments on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqHWAE8GDEk" target="_blank">KLM Surprise video on YouTube</a>, over ten of them are negative, several involving complaints about lost luggage and poor customer service. Perhaps these issues were solved through private messages or on other platforms; however, the lack of response from a KLM representative makes it appear that first, the company ignores their YouTube channel, and second, that they ignore their customers. These assumptions may be false — but first impressions are everything.</p>
<p>Secondly, despite researching I cannot find anything (published by KLM or a third-party group) that discusses the ROI of the experiment. Sure they got one million impressions on Twitter — but did they gain new customers? How many? Did flight bookings go up? What was the actual <em>goal</em> of the experiment?</p>
<p>I’d love to see a case study of KLM’s campaign. Was it worth the effort and time it took to research customers, the cost of the gifts, etc.? KLM has the potential to bring more legitimacy to the idea of using social media to boost business, and they’re letting it slip away.</p>
<h2>The takeway</h2>
<p>Although KLM certainly got a lot of social media attention by surprising their customers with gifts, I don’t think they capitalized on it as much as they could have. Now that the experiment is over, they don’t seem to be monitoring as closely the channels they were using to spread the word: their YouTube channel is ignored, and the KLM Suprise website is static.</p>
<p>The best thing about KLM’s experiment is that it has shown other businesses that social media can be a viable platform for connecting with customers and getting measurable results; the worst thing is that KLM had the opportunity to take it even a step further, and they fell short.</p>

<p>One woman who was going hiking in Rome was given a watch that tracks distances and walking speed; a man traveling to Mexico to build houses for the homeless was given a care package of muscle ointment and adhesive bandages; an elderly woman traveling alone was upgraded to first class seating.</p>
<p>How did KLM know just which gifts to get each customer? The answer: social media.</p>
<h2>The experiment</h2>
<p>All this gift-giving was a part of <a href="http://www.klm.com/" target="_blank">KLM Surprise</a>, the company’s effort to not only connect with its customers on a personal level, but also an experiment in the power of social sharing.</p>
<p>Flight attendants browsed <a href="http://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and <a href="https://foursquare.com/" target="_blank">Foursquare</a>, looking for people who mentioned that they were taking a KLM flight. Then, using the information the customer provided about him or herself on social media platforms, the flight attendants purchased a suitable gift and presented it to the passenger upon his/her arrival at the airport.</p>
<p>According to the photos on the KLM Surprise website, at least 40 KLM customers were given gifts.</p>
<h2>The result: A social media storm</h2>
<p>40 isn’t a staggering number. But news of these surprises spread like wildfire through mentions, tweets, retweets, and word of mouth. In November, the <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/KLMsurprise" target="_blank">KLM Twitter feed</a> was viewed more than <em>one million times</em>. Not bad for a company that wasn’t sure it could make social media work for them.</p>
<h2>What KLM did right</h2>
<h3>Being where their customers are</h3>
<p>KLM did their homework, and made it a priority to seek out their followers and create relationships with them. They created a website and Twitter feed dedicated to their campaign, joined Foursquare, and posted their video on their YouTube channel and the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/home.php#!/KLM" target="_blank">KLM Facebook Fan page</a>. They attempted to start and join conversations on those platforms, and get a feel for what their customers are like.</p>
<h3><strong>Knowing <i>who</i> their customers are</strong></h3>
<p>Then they took it one step forward and personalized their campaign. They could have saved time and presented those 40-some passengers with a generic gewgaw; instead, the employees took the time to learn more detail, and give their customers something that had real value to <em>them</em>.</p>
<h2>Where they missed an opportunity</h2>
<p>Although KLM did a great job of interacting with the 40 or so passengers to whom they presented gifts, their interaction with their wider customer base is lacking, and they have lost additional opportunities to develop their brand.</p>
<p>For example, of the 62 comments on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pqHWAE8GDEk" target="_blank">KLM Surprise video on YouTube</a>, over ten of them are negative, several involving complaints about lost luggage and poor customer service. Perhaps these issues were solved through private messages or on other platforms; however, the lack of response from a KLM representative makes it appear that first, the company ignores their YouTube channel, and second, that they ignore their customers. These assumptions may be false — but first impressions are everything.</p>
<p>Secondly, despite researching I cannot find anything (published by KLM or a third-party group) that discusses the ROI of the experiment. Sure they got one million impressions on Twitter — but did they gain new customers? How many? Did flight bookings go up? What was the actual <em>goal</em> of the experiment?</p>
<p>I’d love to see a case study of KLM’s campaign. Was it worth the effort and time it took to research customers, the cost of the gifts, etc.? KLM has the potential to bring more legitimacy to the idea of using social media to boost business, and they’re letting it slip away.</p>
<h2>The takeway</h2>
<p>Although KLM certainly got a lot of social media attention by surprising their customers with gifts, I don’t think they capitalized on it as much as they could have. Now that the experiment is over, they don’t seem to be monitoring as closely the channels they were using to spread the word: their YouTube channel is ignored, and the KLM Suprise website is static.</p>
<p>The best thing about KLM’s experiment is that it has shown other businesses that social media can be a viable platform for connecting with customers and getting measurable results; the worst thing is that KLM had the opportunity to take it even a step further, and they fell short.</p>

The goal is to maximize your return on investment (ROI) by using keywords which are most relevant to your business, and are more likely to result in traffic, conversions, and sales.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the best ROI for your business, it is critical to avoid mistakes which result in an inefficient use of budget and poorly performing PPC campaigns. Here are 10 common mistakes and how to avoid them.</p>
<p><strong>1. Setting a daily budget </strong></p>
<p>Google AdWords allows you to set a daily budget for each campaign in an account. Once a budget is set, AdWords does its best to not accrue more clicks per day than the budget allows. For many who are new to PPC this is a tempting feature, because it gives total control over the budget; unfortunately it gives that control to the program, rather than to you.</p>
<p>When your daily budget is close to being expended, AdWords starts to throttle the number of times your ads show. This slows the budget spend, but your business comes up fewer times in search results. This means fewer chances for a user to see your ad, visit your site, and convert.</p>
<p>We’ve found that by not setting a daily budget--or by setting an extremely high one--we can be sure that AdWords is showing our clients’ ads as often as the keywords are being searched on. The trade-off is that we have to keep a closer eye on our campaigns to make sure that we are not exceeding the budget.</p>
<p><strong>2. Using only one ad group </strong></p>
<p>In any AdWords account there can be up to 25 campaigns, and within each campaign there can be 2,000 ad groups. Although most accounts are run optimally with far fewer campaigns and ad groups, the ability to be as granular as possible should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>AdWords attempts to target keywords within an ad group to the ads you create -- if a keyword does not match up well with any of the ads, it will not be used. A bookstore owner who dumps all his keywords into a single ad group will have difficulty targeting those keywords to specific ads within that group. Keyword <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=49174" target="_blank">Quality Scores</a> will suffer, which leads to having to bid more to have ads shown.</p>
<p>Instead of lumping everything together, the bookstore owner might begin by separating all his keywords and ads related to children’s books into one ad group, and then create another ad group which would contain keywords and ads related to biographies, another to journals, and so forth.</p>
<p>By placing targeted related keywords into a common AdWords ad group, and creating ads which correspond to those keywords, you will maintain tighter control over the group’s performance. All of your ads will be relevant to all of your keywords, increasing the campaign’s effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>3. Poorly researched keywords </strong></p>
<p>PPC campaigns begin with keywords, and keyword should always start with research. What keywords or phrases are important to your business? Are people searching for those phrases? Use the same keywords your customers do; if you sell a line of energy bars, don’t spend time trying to rank well for the keyword energy bars if your customers call them meal replacement bars.</p>
<p>Shorter, more generic keywords require higher bids, and visitors who search with them are often in the research and browsing phase of the buying cycle. Getting people to your site is important -- but it’s also important that those visitors be qualified leads who are interested in converting. Around here we’re big fans of <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/whiteboard-friday-ignore-the-tail-at-your-peril" target="_blank">long tail keywords</a>: they cost less than bidding on more popular, less specific keywords, and they ensure that our campaigns weed out the tire-kickers.</p>
<p>I use free programs like <a href="https://adwords.google.com/o/Targeting/Explorer?__u=1000000000&amp;__c=1000000000&amp;ideaRequestType=KEYWORD_IDEAS#search.none" target="_blank">Google Keyword Tool</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#" target="_blank">Google Insights for Search</a> to see what keywords are most popular in my area and around the globe; for a closer look at the keywords visitors to our sites are using, I create a keyword report in my analytics program.</p>
<p><strong>4. Too many keywords </strong></p>
<p>As I’ve discovered, it is possible for keyword research to go <em>too</em> far. My research may have yielded a list of hundreds or thousands of keywords, but it’s important for me to remember that I will have to manage all of them. It is easier to optimize a list of 20 - 30 keywords than it is to optimize a list of hundreds.</p>
<p>If your current campaigns have lots of extraneous words, getting rid of them will clear space and time for you to optimize the keywords which are performing well. I recently did a “keyword dump” in an account, and now feel as if I have a better handle on managing it.</p>
<p><strong>5. Ignoring negative keywords </strong></p>
<p>When it comes to optimizing a PPC campaign, you need to avoid clicks which result in bounces. One quick, easy way to lessen these fruitless clicks without having to spend hours with your keywords lists is to add <em>negative keywords</em> to your campaigns. Negative keywords are words or phrases for which you tell AdWords <em>not</em> to trigger your ads.</p>
<p>A large company which specializes in home building and selling will want to rank well for keywords like <em>home builder</em> and <em>new homes</em>. However, because they do not rent homes or build apartments or condominiums, their negative keywords may be phrases such as <em>apartments</em>, <em>new condominiums</em>, and <em>homes for rent</em>.</p>
<p>By adding these as negative keywords, the home builder will minimize clicks from people who are searching for services the company doesn’t provide. This means a lower bounce rate, more profitable visits, and a more optimized PPC campaign.</p>
<p><strong>6. Not scoping out the competition</strong></p>
<p>Very few businesses have zero competition. Take some time to see what your top two or three competitors are doing with PPC. See what keywords are triggering their ads, what position those ads are in search results, and what the ads themselves say. Avoid the mistakes they’re making and improve on what they’re doing right.</p>
<p><strong>7. Not including keywords in ad text </strong></p>
<p>When the keyword or phrase a user searches with triggers an ad that contains that exact phrase, the phrase will be in bold in the search results. Google wants users to find what they’re looking for and knows when an ad is relevant -- bold text attracts the eye, making it more likely for the ad to be noticed and clicked on.</p>
<p>While many ad writers place keywords in ads’ titles, they often forget to include in the ads’ text. An ad in which a given phrase is included two times will have more relevance according to Google, and will have twice the amount of bold text, making it more prominent.</p>
<p><strong>8. Sending visitors to your homepage </strong></p>
<p>After I’ve spent time doing keyword research and creating multiple specific ad groups, I don’t undo all my work by making a website’s homepage the destination URL for all of my new ads.</p>
<p>It’s my goal to make it as easy and quick as possible for a website’s visitors to find what they want. In the same way that I spend time correlating ads to keywords, I also make sure that the ads I’m creating take visitors to a relevant page: an ad for a 50% off sale should take the visitor to a landing page which talks about that sale, or the products which are eligible for it.</p>
<p>Keyword Quality Scores are based on the relevancy of the content to which ads are directed; sending an ad to an irrelevant page will result in lower scores, and you will have to bid more on your keywords to retain your ads’ placement in search results.</p>
<p>If you do not have a relevant page to which to direct a user, consider whether or not the ad is relevant to your campaigns. If it is, create a separate landing page with relevant content and direct the ad there.</p>
<p><strong>9. Not tracking conversions</strong></p>
<p>Much of your effort is wasted if you’re not tracking your campaign’s effectiveness: the only way to determine the success of your PPC campaigns is by tracking the actions you want your customers to take on your website (filling out a contact form, downloading a white paper, making a purchase, etc.).</p>
<p><a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=86275" target="_blank">Setting up conversion tracking</a> in AdWords is easy, and once it’s enabled you will be able to see which campaigns, ads, and keywords are bringing you the best ROI.</p>
<p><strong>10. Not testing</strong></p>
<p>Testing is something you should be doing, even if you have a satisfactory conversion rate.</p>
<p>Test everything. Periodically research new keywords; weed out keywords with few impressions and no clicks; set your <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=112876" target="_blank">ad rotation</a> to “Optimize” and AdWords will show ads with higher click-through rates more often, ensuring better positions in search engine results.</p>
<p>Conduct <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=71976" target="_blank">A/B testing</a> on your website’s landing pages, and see which version leads to more conversions. Don’t be afraid to go over budget if it means an improved ROI.</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The mistakes described here are common, and need only time and diligence to correct. Taking time to research, set up tracking, and test your PPC campaigns is half the battle of SEO -- by avoiding these mistakes you will improve your campaigns, increase conversions, make your spending more effective, and improve your return on investment.</p>

<p>By adding these as negative keywords, the home builder will minimize clicks from people who are searching for services the company doesn’t provide. This means a lower bounce rate, more profitable visits, and a more optimized PPC campaign.</p>
<p><strong>6. Not scoping out the competition</strong></p>
<p>Very few businesses have zero competition. Take some time to see what your top two or three competitors are doing with PPC. See what keywords are triggering their ads, what position those ads are in search results, and what the ads themselves say. Avoid the mistakes they’re making and improve on what they’re doing right.</p>
<p><strong>7. Not including keywords in ad text </strong></p>
<p>When the keyword or phrase a user searches with triggers an ad that contains that exact phrase, the phrase will be in bold in the search results. Google wants users to find what they’re looking for and knows when an ad is relevant -- bold text attracts the eye, making it more likely for the ad to be noticed and clicked on.</p>
<p>While many ad writers place keywords in ads’ titles, they often forget to include in the ads’ text. An ad in which a given phrase is included two times will have more relevance according to Google, and will have twice the amount of bold text, making it more prominent.</p>
<p><strong>8. Sending visitors to your homepage </strong></p>
<p>After I’ve spent time doing keyword research and creating multiple specific ad groups, I don’t undo all my work by making a website’s homepage the destination URL for all of my new ads.</p>
<p>It’s my goal to make it as easy and quick as possible for a website’s visitors to find what they want. In the same way that I spend time correlating ads to keywords, I also make sure that the ads I’m creating take visitors to a relevant page: an ad for a 50% off sale should take the visitor to a landing page which talks about that sale, or the products which are eligible for it.</p>
<p>Keyword Quality Scores are based on the relevancy of the content to which ads are directed; sending an ad to an irrelevant page will result in lower scores, and you will have to bid more on your keywords to retain your ads’ placement in search results.</p>
<p>If you do not have a relevant page to which to direct a user, consider whether or not the ad is relevant to your campaigns. If it is, create a separate landing page with relevant content and direct the ad there.</p>
<p><strong>9. Not tracking conversions</strong></p>
<p>Much of your effort is wasted if you’re not tracking your campaign’s effectiveness: the only way to determine the success of your PPC campaigns is by tracking the actions you want your customers to take on your website (filling out a contact form, downloading a white paper, making a purchase, etc.).</p>
<p><a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=86275" target="_blank">Setting up conversion tracking</a> in AdWords is easy, and once it’s enabled you will be able to see which campaigns, ads, and keywords are bringing you the best ROI.</p>
<p><strong>10. Not testing</strong></p>
<p>Testing is something you should be doing, even if you have a satisfactory conversion rate.</p>
<p>Test everything. Periodically research new keywords; weed out keywords with few impressions and no clicks; set your <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=112876" target="_blank">ad rotation</a> to “Optimize” and AdWords will show ads with higher click-through rates more often, ensuring better positions in search engine results.</p>
<p>Conduct <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=71976" target="_blank">A/B testing</a> on your website’s landing pages, and see which version leads to more conversions. Don’t be afraid to go over budget if it means an improved ROI.</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p>
<p>The mistakes described here are common, and need only time and diligence to correct. Taking time to research, set up tracking, and test your PPC campaigns is half the battle of SEO -- by avoiding these mistakes you will improve your campaigns, increase conversions, make your spending more effective, and improve your return on investment.</p>

<p>The two things you mention, budget and value, really depend on the customer for whom you're setting up AdWords. </p>
<p>Different industries have different levels of competition, so some businesses have to utilize higher budgets in order to have their ads rank high.</p>
<p>Value per lead is also set by the customer. How much money do they make when a person buys a product or service, compared to how much it costs to get them to buy (from search to clink to conversion)?</p>
<p>These are both subjective categories, and change from business to business.</p>

The goal is to maximize your return on investment (ROI) by using keywords which are most relevant to your business, and are more likely to result in traffic, conversions, and sales.</p>
<p>In order to ensure the best ROI for your business, it is critical to avoid mistakes which result in an inefficient use of budget and poorly performing PPC campaigns. Here are 10 common mistakes and how to avoid them.</p>
<p><strong>1. Setting a daily budget </strong></p>
<p>Google AdWords allows you to set a daily budget for each campaign in an account. Once a budget is set, AdWords does its best to not accrue more clicks per day than the budget allows. For many who are new to PPC this is a tempting feature, because it gives total control over the budget; unfortunately it gives that control to the program, rather than to you.</p>
<p>When your daily budget is close to being expended, AdWords starts to throttle the number of times your ads show. This slows the budget spend, but your business comes up fewer times in search results. This means fewer chances for a user to see your ad, visit your site, and convert.</p>
<p>We’ve found that by not setting a daily budget--or by setting an extremely high one--we can be sure that AdWords is showing our clients’ ads as often as the keywords are being searched on. The trade-off is that we have to keep a closer eye on our campaigns to make sure that we are not exceeding the budget.</p>
<p><strong>2. Using only one ad group </strong></p>
<p>In any AdWords account there can be up to 25 campaigns, and within each campaign there can be 2,000 ad groups. Although most accounts are run optimally with far fewer campaigns and ad groups, the ability to be as granular as possible should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>AdWords attempts to target keywords within an ad group to the ads you create -- if a keyword does not match up well with any of the ads, it will not be used. A bookstore owner who dumps all his keywords into a single ad group will have difficulty targeting those keywords to specific ads within that group. Keyword <a href="http://adwords.google.com/support/aw/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=49174" target="_blank">Quality Scores</a> will suffer, which leads to having to bid more to have ads shown.</p>
<p>Instead of lumping everything together, the bookstore owner might begin by separating all his keywords and ads related to children’s books into one ad group, and then create another ad group which would contain keywords and ads related to biographies, another to journals, and so forth.</p>
<p>By placing targeted related keywords into a common AdWords ad group, and creating ads which correspond to those keywords, you will maintain tighter control over the group’s performance. All of your ads will be relevant to all of your keywords, increasing the campaign’s effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>3. Poorly researched keywords </strong></p>
<p>PPC campaigns begin with keywords, and keyword should always start with research. What keywords or phrases are important to your business? Are people searching for those phrases? Use the same keywords your customers do; if you sell a line of energy bars, don’t spend time trying to rank well for the keyword energy bars if your customers call them meal replacement bars.</p>
<p>Shorter, more generic keywords require higher bids, and visitors who search with them are often in the research and browsing phase of the buying cycle. Getting people to your site is important -- but it’s also important that those visitors be qualified leads who are interested in converting. Around here we’re big fans of <a href="http://www.seomoz.org/blog/whiteboard-friday-ignore-the-tail-at-your-peril" target="_blank">long tail keywords</a>: they cost less than bidding on more popular, less specific keywords, and they ensure that our campaigns weed out the tire-kickers.</p>
<p>I use free programs like <a href="https://adwords.google.com/o/Targeting/Explorer?__u=1000000000&amp;__c=1000000000&amp;ideaRequestType=KEYWORD_IDEAS#search.none" target="_blank">Google Keyword Tool</a> and <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search/#" target="_blank">Google Insights for Search</a> to see what keywords are most popular in my area and around the globe; for a closer look at the keywords visitors to our sites are using, I create a keyword report in my analytics program.</p>
<p><strong>4. Too many keywords </strong></p>
<p>As I’ve discovered, it is possible for keyword research to go <em>too</em> far. My research may have yielded a list of hundreds or thousands of keywords, but it’s important for me to remember that I will have to manage all of them. It is easier to optimize a list of 20 - 30 keywords than it is to optimize a list of hundreds.</p>
<p>If your current campaigns have lots of extraneous words, getting rid of them will clear space and time for you to optimize the keywords which are performing well. I recently did a “keyword dump” in an account, and now feel as if I have a better handle on managing it.</p>
<p><strong>5. Ignoring negative keywords </strong></p>
<p>When it comes to optimizing a PPC campaign, you need to avoid clicks which result in bounces. One quick, easy way to lessen these fruitless clicks without having to spend hours with your keywords lists is to add <em>negative keywords</em> to your campaigns. Negative keywords are words or phrases for which you tell AdWords <em>not</em> to trigger your ads.</p>
<p>A large company which specializes in home building and selling will want to rank well for keywords like <em>home builder</em> and <em>new homes</em>. However, because they do not rent homes or build apartments or condominiums, their negative keywords may be phrases such as <em>apartments</em>, <em>new condominiums</em>, and <em>homes for rent</em>.</p>
<p>By adding these as negative keywords, the home builder will minimize clicks from people who are searching for services the company doesn’t provide. This means a lower bounce rate, more profitable visits, and a more optimized PPC campaign.</p>
<p><strong>6. Not scoping out the competition</strong></p>
<p>Very few businesses have zero competition. Take some time to see what your top two or three competitors are doing with PPC. See what keywords are triggering their ads, what position those ads are in search results, and what the ads themselves say. Avoid the mistakes they’re making and improve on what they’re doing right.</p>

Google wants users to find what they’re looking for and knows when an ad is relevant -- bold text attracts the eye, making it more likely for the ad to be noticed and clicked on.</p>
<p>While many ad writers place keywords in ads’ titles, they often forget to include in the ads’ text. An ad in which a given phrase is included two times will have more relevance according to Google, and will have twice the amount of bold text, making it more prominent.</p>
